1. **Graph Search Algorithms**
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traverses the graph layer by layer.
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch.
   - **Depth-Limited Search (DLS):** Similar to DFS but with a depth limit.
   - **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS):** Combines the benefits of DFS and BFS by performing DFS with increasing depth limits.

2. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
   - Implements a graph traversal that expands the least-cost node.
   - Demonstrates finding a path with costs between nodes.

3. **Heuristic-Based Algorithms**
   - **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS):** Uses a heuristic to select the next node.
   - **A* Search:** Combines path cost and heuristic to find an optimal path.
   - Outputs include paths and total costs.

4. **Simulated Annealing**
   - A metaheuristic optimization algorithm for minimizing a cost function.
   - Starts with an initial solution and iteratively improves it by exploring neighboring solutions with a probability influenced by a cooling schedule.

5. **Genetic Algorithm**
   - A biologically inspired optimization algorithm.
   - Implements fitness evaluation, mutation, and crossover to evolve solutions.
   - Demonstrates solving problems like the 8-queens puzzle with genetic operators.
